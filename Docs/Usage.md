## Flowchart

The following flowchart captures the primary logic of the jukebox. 

![Flowchart](./Diag.png)

Note that the flowchart is simplified and does not reflect all the details of the code. It just serves as a high-level overview of the jukebox's functionality and can be used as a usage reference.

## Powering on the Jukebox

To power the jukebox on or off, flip the switch located on the power strip at the back-left side of the jukebox.

> **Note:** It is normal to hear a loud "pop" sound when flipping the switch.

Once powered on, the jukebox will require a short period to boot. It is ready to use when the lights begin flashing.

## Volume Control

At boot, the jukebox will start at its lowest volume. To adjust the volume, use the volume buttons located at the back-right side of the jukebox.

## Selecting a Song

Enter the song number using the keypad. To confirm your selection, press the **`G`** key. The jukebox will begin playing your chosen song.

To cancel your current entry, press the **`R`** key. **Note: Your input will also automatically clear if no keys are pressed for 5 seconds.**

## Playing a Random Song

To play a random song, press the **ðŸ”µ`(BLUE)`** key. The jukebox will select a random song from its library and begin playing it.

## Aborting a Song

To stop a song currently playing, press the **ðŸ”´`(RED)`** key. This will immediately return you to the main menu.

## Soundboard Mode

To activate soundboard mode, press the **ðŸŸ¡`(YELLOW)`** key. In this mode, the keypad functions as a soundboard.

The jukebox has 10 soundboard banks. Upon entering soundboard mode, Bank 1 is automatically selected. Switch between banks using the **ðŸ”´`(RED)`** key (Next bank) and the **ðŸ”µ`(BLUE)`** key (Previous bank).

To exit soundboard mode, press the **ðŸŸ¡`(YELLOW)`** key again. Alternatively, soundboard mode will automatically exit and return to the main menu if no input is detected for 60 seconds.

## Uploading Songs

To upload songs to the jukebox:

1. Connect to the TuDo WiFi
2. Open [`jukebox.local`](jukebox.local) in your web browser
3. Select your desired track number
4. Upload your song either via file or URL (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud etc.)

This shall remain a secret ;)
